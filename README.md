# OpenShelf 📚

OpenShelf is a simple and elegant React app to discover books using the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). Just type a book title, and it will show results with covers, authors, and direct links to OpenLibrary.

## 🚀 Live Demo
[OpenShelf on StackBlitz]()

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Built with **React (Vite)** for fast development, styled using **Bootstrap** for a clean responsive layout, and **React Toastify** for toastr-style notifications. It fetches book data from the **Open Library API** with plain **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**.

## ✨ Features
- Search books by title with instant results  
- Book cards displaying cover image, title, author(s), and first publish year  
- Direct link to each book’s OpenLibrary page  
- Responsive grid layout using Bootstrap  
- Loading spinner while results are fetched  
- Toast notifications for empty searches, no results, and network/API errors  
- Clean and minimal UI with navbar and search bar
